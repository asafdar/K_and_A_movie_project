    "- We then looked at which studios fared better with which genre, to determine the studios we would most like to work with.\n",
    "- We further broke it down by month, to see if certain genres fared better in certain times of the year.\n",
    "- Finally, we looked at whether the time of the month a movie is released (beginning, middle, or end) is a contributing factor.\n",
